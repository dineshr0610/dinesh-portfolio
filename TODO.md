# TODO for Tailwind CSS Setup

- [x] Install the missing PostCSS plugin (already installed)
- [ ] Make sure postcss.config.js uses the new plugin
- [x] Ensure tailwind.config.js has correct content paths for Nuxt (already correct)
- [ ] Confirm your Tailwind CSS file exists and is imported
- [ ] Restart the dev server
- [ ] Quick test that Tailwind works
